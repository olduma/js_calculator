This is a simple calculator application implemented in JavaScript. 

- The calculator has a basic user interface with a screen and buttons for numbers and operations.
- The code uses an event listener to handle button clicks and key presses, and then performs the appropriate action based on the button or key pressed. The calculator can handle basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as percentage and sign change.
- The num function is used to append the number pressed to the screen. The plus, minus, multiply, and divide functions are used to perform their respective operations. - The result function calculates the total based on the current operation and displays it on the screen. The back function is used to delete the last character on the screen. The point function adds a decimal point to the current number.
- The code also uses the classList property to add and remove CSS classes to change the appearance of the buttons when they are clicked or pressed.
